    The objective of the Canteen and meal service is to protect by reducing the
    risk of foodborne illness, with proper sanitary conditions, and preventing
    adulterated food. From the very beginning of the College in 2003, the
    College Canteen has been functioning efficiently. The canteen is located
    inside the College. The hostellers and day scholars are provided meals by
    assuring food safety and quality. The students who come from faraway places,
    start their journey to the College early in the morning. The mid-day meal is
    provided. Even many day-scholars use canteen facilities for their breakfast
    and evening tea with snacks. Presently there are 130 students in the two
    hostels of the College. They are provided with three meals a day, bed coffee
    and evening tea/coffee. The Management of the Canteen is directly under the
    control of the College Administration. Students and staff of the College are
    benefited by the College canteen. The menu will be planned by the assigned
    team of Management and instructions will be given to the Contractor. The
    contract of the Canteen will be renewed every year. The periodical meeting
    will be conducted by the team of Management and Contractors in order to
    appraise the function of the Canteen. Liberalization of food trade, growing
    consumer demand, physical set up, and sanitary conditions are also discussed
    during the appraisal. Also, suggestions, complaints, and problems of the
    food consumers are taken into consideration.
